ðŸ§¾ Terminology Reference (Shopify Data)
To maintain clarity and consistency during the Shopify Sales Analysis project, I created a detailed Terminology Document. This document outlines the key fields used in the dataset along with their meanings and business relevance.

It covers important attributes such as:

Customer details (e.g., Customer ID, Billing Address)

Order information (e.g., Order Number, Invoice Date, Currency)

Product and sales data (e.g., Product ID, Quantity, Subtotal Price)

Payment and tax breakdown (e.g., Gateway, Total Tax, Total Price in USD)

Having this reference helped ensure everyone involved in the projectâ€”from data analysts to stakeholdersâ€”had a clear understanding of what each field represents, how it's used, and why it matters in a business context.

The glossary also helped in cleaning up and validating fields like "CITY," where redundancy or unclear labeling existed in the raw data.
